This is not \u000d\u000amerely an untested belief: Every year for the past 30 years I have witnessed this \u000d\u000atransformation happen with students at the Edible Schoolyard in Berkeley, California, \u000d\u000aa garden and kitchen classroom in a public middle school. I have also witnessed \u000d\u000athis transformation occur with gardeners working in a horticulture training program \u000d\u000aat a jail. People from countries all over the world\u2014young, old, from countless \u000d\u000adifferent cultures and communities\u2014experience this change. All around the globe, \u000d\u000aI have seen the same evidence time and again: Planting, growing, and harvesting \u000d\u000ayour own food engenders patience, love of nature, confidence in your own abilities, \u000d\u000aand\u2014perhaps most powerfully of all\u2014a deep and abiding pleasure derived from \u000d\u000athe work.\u000d\u000aThe Homeless Garden Project is a beautiful example of the therapeutic power \u000d\u000aof gardening. In a world where people experiencing homelessness are often \u000d\u000amarginalized and stripped of dignity, this project provides a sanctuary where \u000d\u000atrainees can reconnect with nature, rebuild their self-worth, and cultivate a sense of \u000d\u000acommunity. By engaging in the meaningful work of gardening, participants not only ","3\u000d\u000alearn valuable skills that will empower them and support the growth of local, organic \u000d\u000afood systems, they are finding purpose and accessing pleasure. Because gardening \u000d\u000ais inherently pleasurable: There is the sensorial satisfaction of digging down and \u000d\u000aplanting a seed in the soil\u2014soil you have nurtured and tended so that it\u2019s rich with \u000d\u000anutrients. And then there is the slow, unfurling wonder of watching that seed sprout, \u000d\u000agrow, leaf out, flower, and produce ripe, organic fruit that can nourish you and your \u000d\u000alocal community. If that isn\u2019t a metaphor for hope and renewal, I don\u2019t know what is. \u000d\u000aThis manual provides an important, easy-to-follow blueprint so that like-minded \u000d\u000aprograms can flourish in other communities. The practices detailed here are drawing \u000d\u000afrom over 30 years of experience\u2014not only with running a successful nonprofit \u000d\u000aorganization, but fostering much-needed social and environmental change. Learning \u000d\u000ato care for the land is ultimately about learning to value our own health, the health \u000d\u000aof our community, and the health of the planet. The world needs more humane, \u000d\u000ainclusive programs like the Homeless Garden Project\u2014and this vital book will help \u000d\u000aus achieve just that.","4","5\u000d\u000aChapter 1: Introduction to the \u000d\u000aHomeless Garden Project","\u201cWe\u2019re really working on \u000d\u000agetting people back into \u000d\u000asociety to help strengthen \u000d\u000athe bridge between the \u000d\u000ahoused and unhoused \u000d\u000acommunities by eliminating \u000d\u000astigmas and stereotypes.\u201d\u000d\u000aDarrie Ganzhorn, HGP \u000d\u000aExecutive Director\u000d\u000a6","7\u000d\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re really working on \u000d\u000agetting people back into \u000d\u000asociety to help strengthen \u000d\u000athe bridge between the \u000d\u000ahoused and unhoused \u000d\u000acommunities by eliminating \u000d\u000astigmas and stereotypes.\u201d\u000d\u000aDarrie Ganzhorn, HGP \u000d\u000aExecutive Director\u000d\u000aIn 1990, the Homeless Garden Project in Santa Cruz, California, was \u000d\u000afounded by a group of caring citizens who wanted to assist people \u000d\u000aexperiencing homelessness.

HGP believes that jobs \u000d\u000aand housing create and sustain well being, and that well being supports getting \u000d\u000ajobs and housing. \u000d\u000aA large body of social science research examines relationships among income \u000d\u000aand well-being. For example, a study by Kahneman and Deaton (2010) found \u000d\u000athat emotional well-being increased then leveled off (i.e., income satiation) at a \u000d\u000amiddle class income (i.e., defined as the median U.S. income in this study). The \u000d\u000aresearchers suggest that this is the point at which individuals have sufficient \u000d\u000aincome to meet their basic needs and engage in activities they value (e.g., \u000d\u000aspending time with family and friends). These findings highlight the importance \u000d\u000aof prioritizing policies that ensure that everyone has sufficient income to support \u000d\u000awell-being. Other research finds that Americans are happier when national \u000d\u000aincome inequality is lower (Oishi et al., 2011). The inverse is also true\u2014Americans\u000d\u000aare unhappier when income inequality is higher.

At HGP, this commitment \u000d\u000ais demonstrated daily via the program\u2019s design (e.g., job training, one-onone check-ins with HGP staff and social workers to support trainees\u2019 selfdefined goals). \u000d\u000a\u2022 Mission alignment. Clear goals encourage employees to believe that they are \u000d\u000acontributing to their organization\u2019s mission. For HGP this means that trainees \u000d\u000asecure the tools they need to build a home in the world and that they are working \u000d\u000atoward an inclusive community, workforce and local food system. \u000d\u000aAnother key factor is that HGP\u2019s TE program provides meaningful work.

","82\u000d\u000aThe following positive psychology concepts are relevant to HGP\u2019s work:\u000d\u000a\u2022 Losada Ratio, or the positivity/negativity ratio, is the number of positive \u000d\u000ainteractions divided by the number of negative interactions (Fredrickson & \u000d\u000aLosada, 2005). Although the mathematical modeling of these ratios has been \u000d\u000acritiqued, higher positive ratios tend be associated with greater flourishing \u000d\u000a(Fredrickson, 2013).

At the other end of the spectrum, a following style, \u000d\u000awhich involves listening rather than offering advice, may be appropriate \u000d\u000awhen companionship is needed. As a guiding style, MI is characterized by \u000d\u000aaccompanying, collaborating, and motivating individuals who seek assistance. \u000d\u000aEmphasis is placed on listening to needs and offering expertise if necessary.\u000d\u000aConfronting ambivalence is another core aspect of MI (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). \u000d\u000aMI practitioners often work with clients who simultaneously talk about wanting \u000d\u000ato change and not being able to do so (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). To work through ","87\u000d\u000athis ambivalence, MI practitioners ask questions to elicit client motivation. The \u000d\u000afollowing questions, developed by Miller & Rollnick (2013, p. 11), provide a sense \u000d\u000aof the MI process: \u201c1. Why would you want to make this change? 2. How might \u000d\u000ayou go about it in order to succeed? 3. What are the three best reasons for \u000d\u000ayou to do it? 4. How important is it for you to make this change, and why?\u201d The \u000d\u000apractitioner listens, summarizes what was said, and asks what the client will do. \u000d\u000aAlthough not the actual method, these questions offer insight into MI and its \u000d\u000astrategy for moving clients from ambivalence to change. \u000d\u000aThe Method of Motivational Interviewing\u000d\u000aAccording to Miller and Rollnick (2013, p. 36), MI\u2019s four key processes include \u000d\u000aengaging (e.g., developing a working relationship), focusing (e.g., developing \u000d\u000aand maintaining direction in change-focused conversations), evoking (e.g., \u000d\u000aeliciting client motivations for change), and planning (e.g., committing to \u000d\u000achange and planning for action). MI is visually represented as a staircase, \u000d\u000awith each step serving as the foundation for the next. ","88\u000d\u000aKey MI communication skills (Miller & Rollnick, 2013, pp. 33\u201335):\u000d\u000a\u2022 Asking open questions that elicit reflection and elaboration.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Affirming client strengths, efforts, and resources.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Reflective listening that intuits the meaning of client statements to \u000d\u000aencourage further discussion and exploration.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Summarizing to encourage reflection. \u000d\u000a\u2022 Providing information and advice with permission and to assist clients \u000d\u000awith reaching their own conclusions. \u000d\u000aTranstheoretical Model of Behavior Change\u000d\u000aThe Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change also informs HGP\u2019s social work \u000d\u000aapproach (Prochaska, 1995; 2020). According to this model, individuals move \u000d\u000athrough a series of stages to achieve a desired change: pre-contemplation \u000d\u000a(i.e., not considering change), contemplation (e.g., ambivalent about change), \u000d\u000apreparation (e.g., some experience with change and/or trying to change), action \u000d\u000a(e.g., engaging in change), maintenance (e.g., ongoing commitment to behavior \u000d\u000achange (Prochaska, 1995; 2020). HGP\u2019s social work staff are familiar with this ","89\u000d\u000amodel and encourage movement from one stage to the next. For example, \u000d\u000awhen working through the preparation stage, HGP staff affirm that the trainees \u000d\u000ahave the skills needed for behavior change and encourage small steps. \u000d\u000aCognitive Behavioral Therapy\u000d\u000aCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) emphasizes that individual thoughts, \u000d\u000aemotions, and behaviors influence each other and responses to life \u000d\u000achallenges (REDF, 2017). To encourage emotional regulation, CBT \u000d\u000aencourages individuals to slow their thinking and behaviors to respond \u000d\u000aless automatically in stressful situations. \u000d\u000aCBT is used in transitional employment programs and social enterprises \u000d\u000ato strengthen work readiness skills, including interactions with supervisors, \u000d\u000acoworkers, and customers, and receiving feedback (REDF, 2017). In a 12-\u000d\u000aweek HGP training program focused on cognitive behavioral interventions, \u000d\u000atrainees worked through common workplace situations, noting differences \u000d\u000abetween communication styles (e.g., aggressive versus assertive). Trainees \u000d\u000aengaged in a \u201cmindful moment,\u201d recognizing how their tone, word choices, \u000d\u000aand interactions influence the workplace as well as relationships with \u000d\u000afriends and family. ","External Support Services\u000d\u000aHGP\u2019s social work team assists trainees with \u000d\u000aaccessing programs such as Medi-Cal (health \u000d\u000acare) and CalFresh (food assistance). Although \u000d\u000aHGP does not provide housing, the project \u000d\u000aassists with searches (see \u201cFinding Flatmates\u201d \u000d\u000aposter) and works with trainees on this goal. \u000d\u000aHGP follows a hub-and-spoke approach to \u000d\u000aensuring that trainees\u2019 needs are met. HGP staff \u000d\u000aassist trainees with gaining access to a range \u000d\u000aof services, including dentistry, mental health \u000d\u000asupport, legal advice, transportation, housing, \u000d\u000achildcare, and substance use treatment. HGP \u000d\u000aserves as a centralized hub or resource center for \u000d\u000atrainees seeking support services, while satellite \u000d\u000alocations or other service providers serve as \u000d\u000aconnected spokes. \u000d\u000a90","91","92\u000d\u000aResources\u000d\u000aHGP\u2019s Social Work Binder\u000d\u000aReferences\u000d\u000aAckerman, C.

","Financials: Income \u000d\u000aIn 2019, the majority of the HGP\u2019s operating income (63%) came from \u000d\u000adonors. HGP\u2019s two enterprises generated 26% of their operating income, \u000d\u000awith value-added enterprises bringing in 23% and farm enterprises \u000d\u000ayielding 3%.

To capitalize on highdemand times for VAE products, HGP increased its production and \u000d\u000asecured a temporary retail space in a prominent location in downtown \u000d\u000aSanta Cruz during the holiday season from 1998 to 2015.

","136\u000d\u000aCrop Planning\u000d\u000aAccording to the adage, \u201cto make it in farming you have to sell it first, then \u000d\u000aplant it second.\u201d Pests, diseases, weeds, and erratic weather make growing \u000d\u000acrops difficult yet marketing and selling them can be even harder. This is \u000d\u000aespecially true in areas such as California in which fresh fruits and vegetables \u000d\u000aare abundant. For this reason, it is important to know where your products \u000d\u000awill end up, and how much you need to grow, before planting. \u000d\u000aOnce markets and production goals are determined, a crop plan must be \u000d\u000acreated to meet these goals. To assist with planning, we offer a crop plan\u000d\u000afrom the Homeless Garden Project (2022). ","When considering how much and when to \u000d\u000aplant, it is important to consider the types \u000d\u000aof crop and its life cycle:\u000d\u000a\u2022 Storable, single planting/single harvest \u000d\u000acrops such as potatoes and winter squash.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Non-storable, single or few plantings/\u000d\u000aextended harvest crops such as peppers, \u000d\u000aeggplants, and tomatoes. \u000d\u000a\u2022 Transplanted, succession plantings/\u000d\u000asuccession harvest crops such as \u000d\u000abroccoli, cabbage, kale, and chard. \u000d\u000a\u2022 Direct sown succession plantings/\u000d\u000asuccession harvest crops such as \u000d\u000acarrots and beets. \u000d\u000a137","138\u000d\u000aCreate a sowing schedule to meet production goals:\u000d\u000a\u2022 Estimate the total length (in weeks) of the harvest period in the climate in \u000d\u000awhich you wish to grow produce.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Calculate the number of plants per sowing needed to meet harvest goals; \u000d\u000aAdd 25% more for possible greenhouse and pest problems.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Determine specific sowing dates throughout the season that are needed to \u000d\u000aachieve the harvest goals.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Calculate the quantity of seeds needed and cost.\u000d\u000aAnother farming adage is \u201cplanning is best done in advance.\u201d Taking this to \u000d\u000aheart, crop planning is typically a wintertime activity. When spring arrives, soil \u000d\u000atemperatures rise and crops are ready to be planted. At this time, growers can be \u000d\u000aconfident that they have done all they can to ensure they will meet production \u000d\u000agoals despite inevitable challenges (e.g., pest and disease pressures).

The Conference Board \u000d\u000aof Canada (2022a, 2022b, 2022c) has identified a wide range of employability \u000d\u000askills, including fundamental skills (e.g., problem solve, manage information, \u000d\u000ause numbers and digital tools); personal management skills (e.g., work safely \u000d\u000aand responsibly, continual learning); social and emotional skills (e.g., active \u000d\u000alistening, flexibility), and teamwork skills (e.g., ability to work collaboratively). \u000d\u000aAdditionally, HGP adopted Cara\u2019s five core workplace competencies after \u000d\u000aparticipating in their Workforce Development Solutions Lab: communication; \u000d\u000aconflict resolution; professionalism; teamwork; and time management. These \u000d\u000askills are promoted in trainees\u2019 recruitment and are reinforced throughout the \u000d\u000aprogram (e.g., during Pre-Exit and Exit Plans, resume construction, and Circle \u000d\u000aMeeting \u201cskill of the week\u201d). Please see Chapter 7 for further discussion. ","146\u000d\u000aMilestones \u000d\u000aHGP milestones are trainee accomplishments that build toward graduating \u000d\u000afrom the program. Having clearly articulated milestones provides trainees with \u000d\u000astructure or a roadmap and helps maintain focus toward reaching their goals. \u000d\u000aWell understood milestones also contribute to HGP\u2019s success as a transitional \u000d\u000aemployment program. Achieving milestones is important, however, some \u000d\u000atrainees experience difficulty completing them within the expected timeframe. \u000d\u000aIn these cases, HGP staff and social work interns work closely with individual \u000d\u000atrainees, providing support and assistance that makes catching up and \u000d\u000aachieving milestones at a workable pace possible. \u000d\u000aBecause trainees collaborate with multiple HGP staff and interns over the \u000d\u000acourse of their time with the program, it is crucial that trainee files are up-todate and that records are shared among staff. Staff and interns use hardcopy \u000d\u000awritten forms and file folders to share their records. File folders are confidential \u000d\u000aand stored in a locked cabinet. These forms serve multiple purposes, from \u000d\u000aaiding social work interns in their support of trainees, to establishing structure \u000d\u000aand transparent expectations for trainees, to enabling HGP to evaluate the \u000d\u000aprogram\u2019s long-term effectiveness. While forms are an important method \u000d\u000aof tracking progress, it is genuine connection and relationship that supports \u000d\u000atrainees in meeting their goals. Trainees who strongly align with HGP\u2019s goals, \u000d\u000aand are meeting goals they believe in, tend to be most successful. ","HGP recognized that without structured \u000d\u000amilestones, trainees might drift away from \u000d\u000aperceiving their work as part of a program \u000d\u000awith concrete goals (e.g., assisting people \u000d\u000ain addressing barriers to long-term paid \u000d\u000aemployment, finding stable housing) to \u000d\u000aregarding it only as a part time job. Trainees \u000d\u000aare more likely to meet program goals and \u000d\u000atheir own self-defined objectives when \u000d\u000athey remain focused on momentum and \u000d\u000aprogress toward them. Milestones and \u000d\u000acheck-in meetings remind trainees that \u000d\u000athey need to make progress and meet due \u000d\u000adates. Starting with orientation and their trial \u000d\u000ahire, HGP \u201cbegins with the end in mind\u201d by \u000d\u000aasking trainees to define what successful \u000d\u000aprogram completion means to them. \u000d\u000a147","Social Work Forms\u000d\u000aThe following forms are listed chronologically based on their use in the \u000d\u000aprogram.

During their 40-minute orientation with the PM or \u000d\u000aT&E Supervisor, trainees complete federal and state hiring paperwork (W-4 and \u000d\u000aI-9) and agree to uphold HGP policies regarding non-discrimination, conflict \u000d\u000aresolution, sexual harassment, and payroll procedures. Other forms include:\u000d\u000a\u2022 Rules for the trial hire period.

As a small \u000d\u000aorganization that relies on effective teamwork, addressing workplace conflict \u000d\u000ais crucial. All program trainees and staff are encouraged to address conflicts \u000d\u000aswiftly and seek supervisor support when needed. \u000d\u000a\u2022 Questions ensure the program is a good fit at this time. During trial hires, \u000d\u000aHGP staff review trainees\u2019 responses to assess their preparation.

Clean and sober \u000d\u000awork environment expectations are also reviewed.

Discussing their significance, the Leap \u000d\u000aof Reason Ambassadors Community (2021, p.2) observes, \u201cCircles represent \u000d\u000awholeness, unity, and balance. Every point of the circumference is the exact \u000d\u000asame distance from the center, signaling equality. A circle is a connected line \u000d\u000awithout breaks. It\u2019s also a sacred symbol of enlightenment and spirituality.\u201d \u000d\u000aBased on values of trust, humility, inclusiveness, forgiveness, empathy, and \u000d\u000ashared and personal responsibility, circle meetings promote relationship \u000d\u000abuilding, authenticity, acceptance, and healing (Circle Process, n.d.; Leap \u000d\u000aof Reason Ambassadors Community, 2021). As Pranis (2005, p. 11) notes: \u000d\u000aCircles use structure to create possibilities for freedom: freedom \u000d\u000ato speak our truth, freedom to drop masks and projections, \u000d\u000afreedom to be present as a whole human being, freedom to \u000d\u000areveal our deepest longings, freedom to acknowledge mistakes \u000d\u000aand fears, freedom to act in accord with our core values.\u000d\u000aAlthough rituals associated with circle processes vary across contexts, roles \u000d\u000aassociated with the host/circle keeper and participants remain relatively consistent. ","Circle meetings typically include a beginning (e.g., opening, guiding question \u000d\u000aposed by the host), a middle (e.g., time when everyone can speak uninterrupted), \u000d\u000aand an end (e.g., host closing). There is often, but not always, a \u201ctalking piece\u201d that is \u000d\u000apassed among participants that signals whose turn it is to speak while others listen.\u000d\u000aOver the past 50 years, a range of rights-based movements have informed \u000d\u000aHGP\u2019s circle meetings, including the Civil Rights movement, and women\u2019s and \u000d\u000amen\u2019s movements (Ways of Council, 2017). Circles are especially popular in \u000d\u000asocial change organizing because they are democratic, non-hierarchical, \u000d\u000abuild trust, foster belonging among participants, and highlight concern for \u000d\u000awell-being (Leap of Reason Ambassadors Community, 2021). All of these \u000d\u000afacets are important to many organizing efforts. \u000d\u000a167","For all of these reasons, HGP begins \u000d\u000aeach morning with a circle. Lynne \u000d\u000aBasehore Cooper, one of HGP\u2019s founders, \u000d\u000aestablished circle meetings as a central \u000d\u000aaspect of the program, describing the \u000d\u000acircle as \u201cbased on the idea that We are \u000d\u000aAll One.\u201d Each Tuesday or Wednesday, \u000d\u000adepending on harvest needs, begins with \u000d\u000aa 50-minute circle meeting that includes \u000d\u000atrainees and staff. Circles are facilitated \u000d\u000aby the Training & Education Supervisor \u000d\u000a(T&E) and follow a consistent structure. \u000d\u000a1. The facilitator opens the circle by sharing \u000d\u000aparticipation guidelines that include \u000d\u000aa reminder that comments should be \u000d\u000atailored to HGP\u2019s clean and sober work \u000d\u000aenvironment, cell phones should not \u000d\u000abe used, and that cross-talk should \u000d\u000abe avoided so that everyone is heard. \u000d\u000aParticipants are also reminded to speak \u000d\u000abriefly so that everyone has a turn. \u000d\u000a168","169\u000d\u000a2. The facilitator shares a question based on the PERMA model (please see \u000d\u000aChapter 4) and invites participants to respond when it\u2019s their turn. For example, \u000d\u000aparticipants might be asked, \u201cHow do you support your teammates?\u201d \u000d\u000a3. All circle participants are given the opportunity to respond to the question. \u000d\u000aGiven that there are 25\u201330 circle participants, each response is approximately \u000d\u000aone minute or less. \u000d\u000a4. After all responses are shared, the facilitator reads the skill of the week from \u000d\u000athe whiteboard (e.g., adaptability, managing information, working with others) \u000d\u000awhere it remains so that it can be referred to and reinforced throughout \u000d\u000athe week (see \u201cEmployability Skills\u201d in Chapter 6 for further information). \u000d\u000aAn inspirational quote is shared.\u000d\u000a5. The facilitator makes announcements, HGP staff lead a stretching exercise, \u000d\u000aand HGP farm staff direct trainees in their tasks for the day. \u000d\u000aThere are many benefits to the Tuesday (or Wednesday) Circle, and HGP staff \u000d\u000aand trainees perceive it as integral to the program\u2019s success. Not only is it a \u000d\u000away to build community and solidarity among trainees, it is also a time when \u000d\u000apotential trainees and guests can experience the program. More practically it is \u000d\u000aan effective strategy for sharing important group communications. Additionally, \u000d\u000aevery other day, HGP holds a much briefer circle that emphasizes getting to work. ","170\u000d\u000aTrainees and staff also have abbreviated group meetings throughout \u000d\u000athe week, including twice weekly 10\u201315 minute meetings that include \u000d\u000ameditation and work assignments. On Thursday mornings, HGP staff \u000d\u000aprovide 10-minute \u201chot jobs\u201d announcements about local employment \u000d\u000aopportunities and trainees are encouraged to apply. These meetings \u000d\u000ahelp ensure that employment is top of mind, and employment is the \u000d\u000aprimary focus of the winter job series (see Chapter 9). After lunch each \u000d\u000aday, there is a 5-minute circle to check-in and re-assign work.\u000d\u000aIn sum, circles physically symbolize shared leadership, equality, connection, \u000d\u000aand inclusion, and the circle meetings foster focus, accountability, and \u000d\u000aparticipation from all. The circle elicits wisdom from trainees through their \u000d\u000apersonal storytelling, and these stories provide opportunities for peer \u000d\u000aconnection and support. HGP consistently hears from trainees how much \u000d\u000athey value being with others who have experienced similar challenges and \u000d\u000aare invested in change. Circle meetings illuminate this common ground.","Lunch\u000d\u000aLunch is intentionally humanizing, bringing \u000d\u000atogether trainees, volunteers, and staff to share \u000d\u000aa meal together at HGP\u2019s farm. Minimizing \u000d\u000adistinctions among trainees, volunteers, and staff, \u000d\u000aeveryone breaks bread together, creating space \u000d\u000afor community building and for stereotypes to be \u000d\u000achallenged. Meal preparation typically includes a \u000d\u000avolunteer cook and a trainee who work together. \u000d\u000aTrainees harvest vegetables to make the salad, \u000d\u000aand there is a strong sense of ownership over \u000d\u000athis task. It is rewarding to prepare a healthy, \u000d\u000acommunal meal, and eating organic homecooked meals over meaningful conversation \u000d\u000acontributes to the health and wellbeing of \u000d\u000aeveryone involved. During lunch, trainees \u000d\u000afrequently revisit what was discussed in the \u000d\u000amorning circle to share resources (e.g., \u201cI heard \u000d\u000ayou needed a ride, I can help\u201d) and offer solidarity \u000d\u000a(e.g., \u201cI\u2019m dealing with the same challenge too\u201d). \u000d\u000a171","172\u000d\u000aProduction Trainees\u000d\u000aHGP engages three production trainees specializing in farm field production, farm \u000d\u000aenterprises production, and value-added production, respectively. Trainees who \u000d\u000ahave met their 3-month milestone can apply for these positions and if selected, \u000d\u000awork additional hours weekly to assist HGP staff with these responsibilities. \u000d\u000aTrainees selected for these positions demonstrate strong work performance \u000d\u000aand conduct, serving as \u201crole models\u201d to amplify a positive workplace culture. \u000d\u000aThey also provide supervisory and programmatic support by encouraging \u000d\u000ajunior trainees to reach their next milestone (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m working on my resume. \u000d\u000aHow is your resume coming together?\u201d). Production trainees earn an hourly \u000d\u000awage that is $1.00 higher for their leadership responsibilities. \u000d\u000aBecause production trainees are also program participants who are working to \u000d\u000ameet their own milestones, complex power dynamics can emerge. Although \u000d\u000anot \u201ctrue\u201d supervisors, production trainees may oversee crews and provide \u000d\u000afeedback that is constructive but experienced as unwelcome (e.g., \u201cYou are my \u000d\u000apeer, not my supervisor.\u201d). Production trainees meet weekly with the Training \u000d\u000aand Education Supervisor to talk about challenges and best practices for peer \u000d\u000aleadership. Production trainees generally flourish and take the leadership skills \u000d\u000athey gain to their next place of employment. \u000d\u000a A Circle meeting at the Homeless Garden Project with \u000d\u000aFirst Partner of California Jennifer Siebel Newsom. \u000d\u000aPhoto: Paul Schraub","173","174\u000d\u000aRecovery Support Group\u000d\u000aHGP seeks venues for trainees to engage with each other in and out of the \u000d\u000aworkplace. The Recovery Support Group, a partnership between HGP and \u000d\u000aSobriety Works, a local Santa Cruz organization, provides HGP trainees and \u000d\u000aalumni with substance abuse recovery support. This group was established \u000d\u000awhen an HGP intern who also worked with Sobriety Works identified lack of \u000d\u000atransportation as a barrier to their services. She began offering recovery support \u000d\u000asessions at HGP\u2019s farm immediately following their workday from 2:15 pm\u2013\u000d\u000a3:15 pm. This group is now ongoing, and a Sobriety Works counselor also works \u000d\u000awith trainees and graduates who are Medi-Cal beneficiaries in a confidential \u000d\u000agroup setting, separate from the HGP workday, to empower sobriety. No HGP \u000d\u000astaff participate in these meetings which helps establish boundaries between \u000d\u000aworkplace and recovery spaces. ","175\u000d\u000aEngaging Alumni \u000d\u000aTo further advance trainees\u2019 development and the program\u2019s mission, HGP \u000d\u000amaintains strong relationships with alumni. During their time with HGP, trainees \u000d\u000adevelop a strong sense of community and leaving the program can be difficult. \u000d\u000aAlthough the program has an end point, HGP staff communicate that alumni \u000d\u000aare always welcome and can continue their participation. First, alumni are \u000d\u000ainvited to volunteer at the farm, workshop, store, and special events. In doing \u000d\u000aso, alumni experience the work, circle, lunch, and sense of community they \u000d\u000aknow and love. Second, during the winter job series, select alumni are invited to \u000d\u000apresent as part of an alumni panel (see Chapter 9). Third, alumni are welcome \u000d\u000ato attend the Recovery Support Group. Fourth, alumni are encouraged to \u000d\u000anetwork with current trainees and with each other via HGP\u2019s alumni circle \u000d\u000a(see Chapter 9). Over the years, many alumni have hired trainees or provided \u000d\u000ahousing opportunities. Lastly, HGP occasionally re-hires alumni for limited time \u000d\u000aperiods to assist with farm or workshop duties. Overall, alumni provide essential \u000d\u000apeer support by offering advice, encouragement, and resources. In most cases, \u000d\u000aalumni have transitioned into the workforce and stable housing, and welcome \u000d\u000athe opportunity to share their experiences with current trainees. ","STORIES FROM THE FIELD \u000d\u000a\u201cWe had an alum visit this morning and participate in \u000d\u000aCircle. He was listening to current trainees talk about the \u000d\u000acommunity that\u2019s at the farm and how everyone supports \u000d\u000aone another, and he was really happy to see this continue \u000d\u000abeyond his tenure. He had a sense of pride that it\u2019s still a \u000d\u000aplace people can come for support. He also talked about \u000d\u000ahow being in circle, fostering a sense of community, and \u000d\u000asupporting one another was really important for him while \u000d\u000ahe was at the farm. Now his work outside the Project is \u000d\u000adifferent, and he aims to bring those skills with him to \u000d\u000ahis new job. He said, \u2018If my job isn\u2019t going to offer these \u000d\u000asupports like the farm does, I\u2019m going to be the person to \u000d\u000ado that.\u2019 He\u2019s carrying those skills beyond the circle and \u000d\u000abeyond the farm into his next workplace. It\u2019s motivating \u000d\u000afor people to hear that while other workplaces might not \u000d\u000abe as supportive, you can be the one to build it.\u201d\u000d\u000aEvan Jones, HGP Program Manager\u000d\u000a176","Staff and Social Work Interns\u000d\u000aThrough shared joys and challenges, HGP staff and social work interns \u000d\u000abuild strong relationships with trainees.

Program \u000d\u000aassessment is instrumental to understanding trainees\u2019 experiences \u000d\u000aand growth in the program, and to identifying programmatic \u000d\u000astrengths and areas for improvement. Local universities are \u000d\u000aexcellent sites for forging research partnerships. An evaluation \u000d\u000apartner who is independent from the program can help ensure \u000d\u000aconfidentiality and encourage honest feedback.

As the program has grown, HGP\u2019s data needs and collection \u000d\u000ahave expanded. Since 2006, mission-aligned researchers at the University of \u000d\u000aCalifornia, notably the Center for Economic Justice and Action (CEJA) at the \u000d\u000aUniversity of California, Santa Cruz, have partnered with HGP to assess program \u000d\u000asuccess, identify strengths and areas for improvement, and provide useful \u000d\u000ainformation about trainee outcomes. Trainee assessment data is gathered via \u000d\u000atwo distinct mechanisms: \u000d\u000a1. HGP\u2019s Program Manager collects case management information via a set \u000d\u000aof questionnaires that are completed by trainees at regularly timed intervals \u000d\u000aand stored in a database that HGP oversees. \u000d\u000a2. CEJA researchers ask trainees to complete evaluative questions at the \u000d\u000abeginning and end of their time with the program. Additionally long-term \u000d\u000afollow ups are conducted. Data is also gathered about the Volunteer Program \u000d\u000a(see Chapter 10) and farm and value-added-enterprises (see Chapter 5). This \u000d\u000achapter focuses exclusively on the use of trainee data for program evaluation.","Outcomes\u000d\u000aIn its annual reports, HGP provides core information about trainee outcomes \u000d\u000asuch as the percentage of graduates who secure jobs and housing and the \u000d\u000anumber of hours spent annually in their transitional program. Although there \u000d\u000ais considerable variability across nonprofit programs regarding the most \u000d\u000aimportant metrics for reporting and assessment, selecting and establishing \u000d\u000areliable program tracking systems is a universal need.

HGP asks trainees about \u000d\u000atheir desires, abilities, reasons, and needs (see Chapter 6 \u201cDARN \u000d\u000aform\u201d), assesses uses of change versus sustain talk (see Chapter 4: \u000d\u000a\u201cConversations About Change\u201d), and considers potential for \u000d\u000asuccess in the program.

Is this \u000d\u000astill something you want to do, or would you like to change \u000d\u000ait?\u2019 That\u2019s a good opportunity for a trainee to affirm that \u000d\u000athis is their goal or be upfront that it isn\u2019t.\u201d\u000d\u000aDarrie Ganzhorn, HGP Director\u000d\u000a205","Building a Culture That \u000d\u000aEmbraces Transition\u000d\u000aHGP fosters a culture that embraces transition. \u000d\u000aFor example, upcoming milestones and \u000d\u000agraduations are announced and celebrated \u000d\u000aduring Circle meetings. By focusing attention \u000d\u000aon transition, trainees are reminded of \u000d\u000aHGP\u2019s structure and timeline, and their \u000d\u000aaccomplishments are recognized.

The \u000d\u000a14-week job series runs from January to April, a slower time on the farm due \u000d\u000ato winter weather and reduced post-holiday workshop demands. The series \u000d\u000aruns half- or full-day on Thursdays and is part of trainees\u2019 paid 20-hour work \u000d\u000aweek. Each session is led by HGP staff or guest speakers. The job series also \u000d\u000aengages local employers who meet trainees and experience their commitment \u000d\u000ato securing employment firsthand. \u000d\u000aBecause new trainees are hired throughout the year, participation in the job \u000d\u000aseries occurs at different time points for trainees. Ideally, workshop participation \u000d\u000awould occur at 9 months with the program. For spring entry trainees, the job \u000d\u000aseries occurs toward the end of their 12 months and is well-timed, while fall entry \u000d\u000atrainees complete the job series far earlier in the program. Early participation \u000d\u000acan be beneficial because some trainees secure employment shortly after \u000d\u000acompleting the job series early in their time with HGP. HGP includes job series \u000d\u000amaterials to address varied timelines, in the Social Work Binder, making it \u000d\u000apossible for social workers to mentor trainees individually. In 2024, HGP added \u000d\u000aa second, briefer job series to encourage trainees to explore transitioning out \u000d\u000aand to deepen job search skills. This series is held in late summer.","208\u000d\u000aSession Overviews\u000d\u000a1. Introduction \u000d\u000aThe first session is dedicated to setting group norms and creating a \u000d\u000a\u201cclassroom\u201d learning community, a significant transition from working at the \u000d\u000afarm and workshop. Trainees reflect on their diverse work histories and skills \u000d\u000aand are asked to discuss what they bring to HGP. To fine-tune sessions and \u000d\u000aensure their usefulness, trainees are asked to identify what they hope to gain \u000d\u000afrom the job series. \u000d\u000aTrainees complete a vocational inventory (Holland 1997; Michelozzi et. al., \u000d\u000a2004) that connects personal characteristics with potential careers. The \u000d\u000ainventory is especially helpful for trainees who are unsure about potential \u000d\u000acareer paths. \u000d\u000aBetty and Peter Michelozzi supported the development of HGP\u2019s job series and \u000d\u000aled several sessions each year.

Choose your own adventure\u000d\u000aIn the second session, trainees create vision \u000d\u000aboards to reflect on their interests and \u000d\u000agoals. Vision boards are a tool for creatively \u000d\u000aexpressing individual hopes and objectives \u000d\u000ain different areas of life. In this case, HGP \u000d\u000aasks trainees to envision the qualities of their \u000d\u000aideal job. Trainees also start their job search \u000d\u000aby identifying jobs they hope to pursue. \u000d\u000aSubsequent classes in the job series build \u000d\u000aon these decisions, including creating their \u000d\u000aresume and cover letter. Additionally, trainees \u000d\u000aset their SMART goals (i.e., goals that are \u000d\u000aSMART-specific, measurable, achievable, \u000d\u000arelevant, and time-bound). \u000d\u000a3. Digital Literacy 101 \u000d\u000aIn this session, a guest speaker teaches \u000d\u000aessential job search skills, including creating \u000d\u000aa Gmail account, crafting an email message, \u000d\u000aand navigating Google Docs. Trainees \u000d\u000aFigure 9.4. A HGP trainee\u2019s vision board. ","211\u000d\u000aare guided through clearinghouse (e.g., Monster.com, Indeed.com) and \u000d\u000agovernment (e.g., City of Santa Cruz) job search websites and resume posting \u000d\u000asites (e.g., LinkedIn.com). The session\u2019s pace depends on participants\u2019 skills. \u000d\u000aTo build confidence using computers to meet employment-related goals, \u000d\u000aHGP\u2019s social work team offers weekly computer support. This is an unpaid \u000d\u000aopportunity for trainees.\u000d\u000a4. Banking basics\u000d\u000aIn this session, a guest speaker from the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union \u000d\u000adiscusses the differences between credit unions and banks, how to open \u000d\u000aa bank account, and budgeting. It can be helpful for trainees to learn that \u000d\u000acredit unions typically have lower fees and more ethically based community \u000d\u000adevelopment investments than conventional banks. Trainees are offered the \u000d\u000aopportunity to open an account with the credit union.\u000d\u000aTrainees receive assistance making a budget of their income and expenses, \u000d\u000aand complete a \u201cweekly want\u201d activity in which they record their weekly \u000d\u000aexpenditures to assess an item\u2019s monthly and annual cost. For example, one \u000d\u000atrainee calculated her weekly and annual bingo spending, subsequently \u000d\u000adeciding to forego this activity to pursue other goals. ","212\u000d\u000a5. Crafting a job resume\u000d\u000aHGP staff and community volunteers assist trainees with effective resume \u000d\u000awriting. Each trainee has identified specific jobs by this point, so resumes \u000d\u000aare custom-tailored to positions and trainees\u2019 talents. This session covers \u000d\u000aresume mechanics, from formatting to relevant information for inclusion \u000d\u000ato illuminating how strengths are demonstrated by work and life history. \u000d\u000a6. Credit scores and identity theft \u000d\u000aA guest speaker from the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union discusses \u000d\u000acredit scores and identity theft. This session demystifies how credit scores \u000d\u000aare created, strategies for tracking and improving credit scores (e.g., erasing \u000d\u000adebt, opening a new credit card, paying charges off each month), and how \u000d\u000acredit scores influence the ability to secure stable housing. Identity theft \u000d\u000aand how to avoid phishing scams is also covered.\u000d\u000a7. Creating a cover letter\u000d\u000aA transitional employment specialist from Housing Matters, a local nonprofit \u000d\u000aorganization, leads a session on writing an effective cover letter. The session \u000d\u000aincludes how to speak about prior experience and language for explaining \u000d\u000aemployment gaps. ","213\u000d\u000a8. Alumni panel \u000d\u000aHGP\u2019s Training and Education Supervisor facilitates a panel with five alumni \u000d\u000awho speak about their post-graduation experiences. It is powerful for current \u000d\u000atrainees to learn about alumni pathways and how successes and challenges \u000d\u000aare navigated. The job series as a whole, and this session in particular, \u000d\u000areinforces HGP\u2019s focus on moving from its transitional employment \u000d\u000aprogram to the broader workforce. \u000d\u000a9. Housing resume\u000d\u000aThe housing market in Santa Cruz, California, is highly competitive. In this \u000d\u000asession, trainees work with a Housing Matters guest speaker to assemble \u000d\u000atheir housing application portfolios. Portfolios include the following: a cover \u000d\u000aletter that is designed to make a good first impression; a housing resume \u000d\u000awith personal contact information and contact information for people who \u000d\u000acan provide supportive references; and financial information (e.g., bank \u000d\u000astatements, proof of current income). Trainees are advised to review their \u000d\u000asocial media accounts and consider how prospective landlords might \u000d\u000aperceive this information. During a facilitated group discussion, trainees \u000d\u000awho are housed share their experiences creating a housing resume and \u000d\u000athe process of securing stable housing. ","10. Meet and greet employers/\u000d\u000aemployer panel\u000d\u000aIn this session, employers speak about \u000d\u000atheir organizations and the characteristics \u000d\u000athey seek in employees. HGP works \u000d\u000awith a core group of employers, many of \u000d\u000awhom participate in the panel discussion \u000d\u000aannually (e.g., California State Parks, City \u000d\u000aof Santa Cruz, the Beach Boardwalk, Hotel \u000d\u000aParadox, New Leaf Community Markets, \u000d\u000alocal farms). Typical questions from trainees \u000d\u000ainclude: Would you hire someone with HGP \u000d\u000aexperience? Why or why not?; What do \u000d\u000ayou look for when reviewing a resume or \u000d\u000aduring an interview?; What opportunities for \u000d\u000aadvancement does your company offer? \u000d\u000aHow does work at your company change \u000d\u000aduring the year/seasons?; What is your hiring \u000d\u000aprocess? Responses to these questions \u000d\u000ainform preparation for the final sessions. \u000d\u000a214","215\u000d\u000a11. Interview preparation \u000d\u000aHGP staff and community volunteers review common interview preparation \u000d\u000aconcerns, including what to wear and how to answer sensitive interview \u000d\u000aquestions (e.g., background checks, gaps in employment). \u000d\u000a12. Mock interviews \u000d\u000aEmployers are invited to return to HGP to conduct mock interviews with \u000d\u000atrainees. Trainees are encouraged to dress professionally and to treat the \u000d\u000amock interview as an actual interview. Several trainees have been offered \u000d\u000ajobs after their mock interviews! \u000d\u000a13. Explore workplace culture and relationship building\u000d\u000aIn this session, participants discuss work cultures at various employment \u000d\u000asites (e.g., offices versus outdoors, large versus small organizations, and \u000d\u000afaster versus slower-paced settings). Team building is also covered, with \u000d\u000atrainees participating in team-building activities. The job series closes, \u000d\u000aleaving participants with a sense of community and achievement. ","216\u000d\u000aAlumni Circle\u000d\u000aSince 2017, the Alumni Circle has brought \u000d\u000atogether HGP alumni and current trainees to \u000d\u000atour the farm, build community, and share \u000d\u000apost-graduation experiences. The Alumni Circle \u000d\u000aoriginated from an analysis conducted by the \u000d\u000aCenter for Economic Justice and Action at the \u000d\u000aUniversity of California, Santa Cruz (see Chapter 8). \u000d\u000aDuring interviews, alumni consistently discussed \u000d\u000ahow much they missed the HGP community. \u000d\u000aThe Alumni Circle seeks to reestablish this sense \u000d\u000aof community and support. HGP is continuing \u000d\u000ato strategize about the best format and model \u000d\u000afor this program. For example, getting sufficient \u000d\u000aturnout is difficult, so HGP is experimenting with \u000d\u000aholding the circles on weekdays and weekends. \u000d\u000aDespite limited attendance, participants benefit \u000d\u000afrom Alumni Circle, and HGP remains confident \u000d\u000athat the program will grow.

HGP seeks to retain volunteers not only to maintain a large volunteer \u000d\u000apool but also for their expertise in explaining HGP's mission, and to deepen \u000d\u000arelationships.

To expedite onboarding, these forms \u000d\u000aare sent out prior to a group\u2019s arrival, with completion needed before the \u000d\u000afirst volunteer experience. HGP uses Google Sheets to maintain its volunteer \u000d\u000adatabase (e.g., name, contact information, service dates, and hours) and \u000d\u000acategorize volunteers into groups. These metrics help identify trends such as \u000d\u000asingle versus multiple-time volunteers, comparing volunteer growth from year \u000d\u000ato year, and assessing volunteer impact. A volunteer maintains this database. \u000d\u000aSummer Social Work Volunteers\u000d\u000aHGP\u2019s Volunteer Coordinator and Program Manager collaborate with \u000d\u000auniversities to secure social work interns to work with trainees during the \u000d\u000asummer months when universities are not in full session (please see Chapter 4 \u000d\u000afor details).

In a world in which there are many competing opportunities, \u000d\u000aindividuals must choose whether and how to give time, money, and other \u000d\u000avalued resources. Why should a volunteer, customer, or donor choose your \u000d\u000aorganization over another? Crafting a compelling narrative about the impact \u000d\u000aof your program is essential to garnering support. At HGP, storytelling serves \u000d\u000amultiple functions, including securing funds for the organization, educating the \u000d\u000acommunity about homelessness, reducing stigma by creating understanding, \u000d\u000aand providing opportunities for trainees to share their experiences and shine.\u000d\u000aBetween 2016 and 2021, HGP engaged in a capital campaign to move their farm to \u000d\u000aa permanent location that is three times the size of their current site. HGP created a \u000d\u000abusiness plan outlining how they would triple their impact, launching a successful \u000d\u000a$3.5 million capital campaign (Merzbach, 2021). Although moving to a new location, \u000d\u000aPogonip City Park, was paused due to unforeseen lead contamination of the soil, \u000d\u000awriting a business plan coalesced their 30 history and informed their development \u000d\u000aof a compelling narrative.

People who are \u000d\u000amost familiar and involved with HGP (e.g., Board of Directors) are at the center \u000d\u000aof the bullseye, whereas people unfamiliar with HGP are located in the outer \u000d\u000aring. The aim is to bring people closer toward the center with each interaction \u000d\u000aso that they become more engaged, especially prospective donors. The move \u000d\u000afrom \u201cI\u201d to \u201cwe\u201d signifies a transition of ownership, buy-in, and identity. Put \u000d\u000asimply, this transition can be conceptualized as moving from regarding HGP \u000d\u000aas an organization to viewing HGP as my organization. \u000d\u000aEach relationship is different and needs to be tended to uniquely. Some individuals \u000d\u000amay move from the outer circle to the inner circle quickly while others may take \u000d\u000ayears. It is important to keep in mind that relationships are not linear. Some people \u000d\u000awill move closer to the center for some period of time and then step back. This \u000d\u000ais to be expected. Consider your touch points (e.g., personal emails, going out \u000d\u000afor a coffee) for keeping people in your organization\u2019s orbit. HGP\u2019s fundraising \u000d\u000astrategy is to build the most intimate relationships as broadly as they can. ","251\u000d\u000aWho to Ask? Triple A\u2019s\u000d\u000aHGP receives some funding from foundations, government grants, and \u000d\u000acorporate donations, however, the majority of their funding comes from \u000d\u000aindividual donors. How does HGP decide who to ask for donations?\u000d\u000a\u2022 Access. Who do we know already, and who are we already in \u000d\u000aconversation with? How can we talk with this person? Can they \u000d\u000aintroduce us to others who may be interested? Have they visited \u000d\u000athe farm? Do they know about our work? \u000d\u000a\u2022 Affinity. Who cares about our work related to workforce development? \u000d\u000aWho cares about our work with people experiencing homelessness?\u000d\u000a\u2022 Affluence. Fundraisers often focus narrowly on individuals known to \u000d\u000abe wealthy. However, HGP starts with access and affinity and comes \u000d\u000ato affluence last. This strategy is based on their fundraising experience. \u000d\u000aPeople who care the most about HGP, not necessarily those with \u000d\u000athe greatest financial resources, are their most likely donors.","252\u000d\u000aFundraising is a Team Sport\u000d\u000aFundraising is a team sport that is most successful when everyone associated \u000d\u000awith an organization is involved. It is also most effective when people across \u000d\u000athe strata of the bullseye serve as ambassadors. For example, when donors \u000d\u000aare engaging their communities, you are more likely to reach a new stratum of \u000d\u000asuccess. Development officers need to coach all stakeholders to be fundraisers \u000d\u000arather than doing all of the asking. This includes assisting ambassadors with \u000d\u000awhat to say, providing tools such as print materials and an elevator pitch, and \u000d\u000acoaching ambassadors to draw attention to the website and newsletter. \u000d\u000aNever assume that people know your organization needs donations. People \u000d\u000aneed to hear that your organization requries donations to do its work. Coach \u000d\u000ayour staff, board members, and volunteers to use language that encourages \u000d\u000adonations. We offer two examples: ","When speaking with an individual: \u000d\u000a\u201cWe receive government funding, we receive foundation support, and our \u000d\u000aenterprises bring in money. But it\u2019s really individual support at all levels \u000d\u000athat makes this project happen.\u201d\u000d\u000aWhen speaking to a group, such as at a fundraising dinner: \u000d\u000a\u201cWe wish to thank X donor, and Y donor, and supporters like you.\u201d \u000d\u000aThe tagline \u201csupporters like you\u201d helps make each person know that they \u000d\u000acan be a supporter and that this program is driven by people like them. \u000d\u000a253","254\u000d\u000aVideo Testimonials\u000d\u000aHGP invites trainees to speak at their events. These speeches are available on \u000d\u000atheir YouTube Channel and their blog. Because these testimonials are among the \u000d\u000amost powerful ways to communicate HGP\u2019s value to donors, it is important that \u000d\u000athey are widely accessible. HGP graduate Adam Marshall\u2019s speech, at right, at \u000d\u000atheir 2019 Holiday Celebration is just one example.
